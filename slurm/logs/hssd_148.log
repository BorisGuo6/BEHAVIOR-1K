To avoid a persistent long startup or USD load time on every app launch, recommended to free space by deleting driver caches using one of the following methods:
- By running the app with --/renderer/shadercache/driverDiskCache/flush=true (only once).
- Or by manually deleting the following folders: '%LOCALAPPDATA%/NVIDIA/DXCache/Omniverse' (Windows-DX) or '$omni_cache/shaders/nv_shadercache' (Windows-Vulkan, Linux-Vulkan).
Driver caches will be re-generated which may take a few minutes on the next launch.
